{"text": "<human>: I read that you invest €30K for up to 5%. Does it mean you evaluate my startup at a minimum of €600K?\n<bot>: Yes, if you have not received the investment with a higher valuation.

It's also important to note that the services we provide are not included in the investment, as they are provided \"for free\" on top of it.", "metadata": {"source": "b4i"}}
